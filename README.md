#Considerations
* thought I would use react, never used react before so seemed relevant to the job and good learniing experience
* chose react create app as it seemed easiest
* was using Jest recently and thought I would try that as testing framework
* enzyme again for learning
* es2015 with babel, again for learning
* semantic-ui, because I wanted it to look ok
* travis ci again for the learning

When I say learning, its for things I think are useful to overall project quality.

# Run
* npm start

# 4 hours work
The https://github.com/bmdoherty/diffblue/tree/4_hours_work

This is how far I got in 4 hours, which would be the skeleton of the app.
I carried on to see how it would look in the end, with the things I wanted to add. probably aouther 10 hours
